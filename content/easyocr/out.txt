TRUE/FALSE SN Statement If 0 € Rd then a trace of the matrix is to the Euclidean distarice FALSE between the origin and the @ . 2 PCA becomes equivalent to LDA if we project samples of each class using PCA TRUE independently. 3 For a particular €, the value of the probability mass function can be greater than False one. The PCA will project 2D-data points to [1, 0JT if variance(c) variance(y): TRVE 5 If data distributions exactly follow y-X, then the rank of the covariance matrix TRue will be zero. If X and Y are two real-valued random variables such that Cov(X, Y) < 0 then at least one of X or Y must have negative variance i.e. either o(X) 0 or FALSE o(Y) 0. Naive Bayes assumes that all features are conditionally independent given the TRUE class label. 8 LDA is sensitive to outliers in the dataset. False 9 A die is loaded s0 that the probability of a face coming Up is proportional to the number on that face. The die is rolled with outcome X The expected value of X TrVE is greater than 4. 10 B = {[1,1JT, [-1,0]T} is one of the basis in 2D-space. TRUE aat equal point
