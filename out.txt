Statement

If a € R*, then a trace of the matrix aa’ is equal to the Euclidean distance

between the origin and the point a.

PCA becomes equivalent to LDA if we project samples of each class using PCA

independently.

If data distributions exactly follow y=x, then the rank of the covariance matrix

will be zero.

If X and Y are two real-valued random variables such that Cov( X,Y) < 0 then

at least one of X or Y must have negative variance i.e. either o(X) < 0 or

a(Y) <0.

Naive Bayes assumes that all features are conditionally independent given the

class label.

die is loaded so that the probability of a face coming up is proportional to the
